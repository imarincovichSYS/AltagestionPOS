        In an amazing demonstration Captain VB demonstrated the power, ease and 
        flexibility of Visual Basic. In real world applications VB proved to be 
        more robust, scalable and efficient than even the ex-king of the hill 
        language, C++.

        John Simmons and Chris Maunder were flabergasted after the presentation 
        and a few hours of tinkering by themselves. "It is amazing, I am going 
        to go out and buy VB right now!" said a starry eyed Chris Maunder. John 
        Simmons even apologised to all the VB users he has previously berated 
        for using VB. "It seems as though <b>I</b> was the one in the dark and 
        they had found the light!" 
        exclaimed John.

        exaggerated" said a source close to the heart of CP.
